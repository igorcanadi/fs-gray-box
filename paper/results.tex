In our experiments, we sought to find and compare four different aspects of the 
file system in a host OS running natively on a machine and in a guest OS running
on top of the host. We found and compared the ideal buffer size for random file 
access, prefetch size, file cache size, and at what sizes the file system adds 
another layer of inode pointers in the following subsections.

\subsection{Ideal Buffer Size for Random I/O}
