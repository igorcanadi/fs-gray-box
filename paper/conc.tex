From the results obtained in Section~\ref{sec:results}, we found that the behavior
of identical OSs running directly on a machine and in a virtual machine was 
nearly identical. This suggests that VMware Workstation I/O closely emulates 

To summarize our results, we found the best size for random reads to be a multiple 
of the page size, 4KB, and that for large reads the size with the best throughput
was approximately 7MB. We also found that the maximum prefetch size was 128KB.
