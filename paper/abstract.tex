\begin{abstract}
In this project we measured four aspects of the file system on the Redhat Enterprise Linux 6 operating system running directly on a machine as well as on a virtual machine. We found that he ideal buffer size for random file access was 7MB, prefetch size was 128KB, file cache was dynamic, and file size for which additional levels of inodes are allocated was #KB.
