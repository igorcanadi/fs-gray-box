\begin{abstract}
In this project we measured four aspects of the ext4 file system on Redhat 
Enterprise Linux 6 running directly on a machine as well as on a virtual machine. 
We found that the ideal buffer size for random file access was 4KB, maximum 
prefetch size was 128KB, file cache was dynamic and related to the amount of 
physical memory that was available, and file size for which additional 
levels of inodes are allocated was \#MB.
