In this project we measured and compared four aspects of the ext4 file system on 
Redhat Enterprise Linux 6 running directly on a machine as well as on a virtual machine. 
We found that the ideal buffer sizes for random file accesses were multiples of 
4KB and that the best size for large random I/O was around 7MB. The maximum 
prefetch size was 128KB, and the file cache size was dynamic and depended on 
the amount of physical memory that was available. We also found that, when a file grows,
the point in which ext4 adds another layer of indirection does not depended solely on file size.
